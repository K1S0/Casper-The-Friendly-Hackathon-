# The Friendly Hackathon: Start Building on Casper !
This is my slightly more detailed submission for the "Get started with Casper" project organized as part of the first Casper Blockchain Hackathon. September 2021.
https://gitcoin.co/issue/casper-network/gitcoin-hackathon/29/100026611


--> Five tasks have been completed in order to learn more about the Casper ecosystem :
A screen recording showing my process of completing all the tasks is available on youtube via this link --> https://youtu.be/3pfqtDnjY28 (deploy for the task one can be found in the video below). On this page, I will only show you short but clear screen recordings that show the result of the completion of each task.

<h4>1- Create and deploy a simple Casper smart contract using cargo casper, make test and a local network</h4>

<h4>2- Writing a Casper smart contract</h4>

We will follow the tutorial entitled "A contract Tutorial" which will allow us to familiarize ourselves with the process of deploying and using a contract on Testnet, a local test network. And then we will write a smart contract called the counter contract.

<h4>3- Key management concepts by modifying the client in the Multi-Sig tutorial to address the additional scenario 2</h4>

By following the "Multi-Signature Tutorial" we will learn to use Casperâ€™s permissions model to sign transactions with multiple keys. We will use a smart contract called "keys-manager" and a sample client that invokes the multi-signature feature on a local Casper network. At the end, as a practical example,  we will run the additional scenario number two : deploying with two special keys.

<h4>4- Transfer tokens to an account on the Casper Testnet</h4>

We will transfer in command line 10 CSPR from account 1 to account 2 via the Casper blockchain Testnet. Both accounts have been previously provisioned with CSPR thanks to the faucet tool of the cspr.live website. Account 1 (01117.....41d0c), Account 2 (01215.....b61e0).

<h4>5- Delegation and Undelegation on the Casper Testnet</h4>

We are going to use the cspr.live user interface to delegate and then undelegate 10 CSPR to a Casper Testnet validator. The account testnet1 011178.....41d0c will be our delegator/undelegator and the chosen validator will be this one 017d9.....2009e .
